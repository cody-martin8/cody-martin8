## :speech_balloon: About Me

Hello all! My name is Cody and I'm a web developer. I've worked with React, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, Node.js, JavaScript, and a handful of other languages and frameworks. Adding more languages/frameworks under my belt is definitely a goal that I have moving forward.

I may have a Bachelor's degree in Kinesiology, but I'm happy to have found a new home in web development. The vast number of languages and technologies have made for an exciting learning journey, and the process of coding scratches that puzzle-solving itch. I look forward to finding opportunities for learning and improvement through projects and in employment.

âš¡ Personal Interests:

- Los Angeles Lakers (I also enjoy playing basketball if you need an extra for your team!)
- Gaming with my wife (Overwatch 2 is our favorite right now)
- Finding great food spots (Sushi at SUGARFISH is #1 on our list!)
